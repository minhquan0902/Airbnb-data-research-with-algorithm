In this project, not just using the Data visualization and Information Processing Libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Matploit, I also try to implement the use of Hash Tables and Binary Trees Data Structure; Merge Sort, Binary Search and Hash Table Search Algorithm to conduct the displaying and searching of data within this vast dataset of more than 48000 data entries.

All explanations of Time complexity and the use of each Algorithm can be found within the codes
